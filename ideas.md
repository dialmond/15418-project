Really want to do something with raytracing or image generation. I just think it'd be fun, it'd be interesting

* markov chain text generation - but aren't markov chains pretty sequential?
* chess solver
* CUDA particle simulator

other visual things:
* dithering algorithm
* low poly renderer
* voxel renderer
